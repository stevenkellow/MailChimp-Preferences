**Want to use the functions elsewhere?**

It's easy to use our functions to register users, subscribe them to MailChimp, update their MailChimp information or unsubscribe them.  This can be especially useful when user's perform actions on your site - such as complete an order, post a comment or leave the site.

We even have hooks available, so you can perform actions when a user changes their MailChimp status.

**Our functions include:**

mc_subscribe() - subscribe users  
mc_unsub() - unsubscribe users  
mc_update() - update user's details in MailChimp  
mc_check() - make sure user is still subscribed  
mc_register() - register a WordPress user and subscribe to MailChimp  

** Our hooks include **
'mc_pref_subscribed' - when a user subscribes
'mc_pref_unsubscribed' - when a user unsubscribes
'mc_pref_updated' - when a user updates their MailChimp details
'mc_pref_registered' - when a user registers to your site via our form
